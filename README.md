!! IMPORTANT !! RE: Table of Contents

DO NOT add a Table of Contents to your README or TESTING!!
These are outdated since 2021 when GitHub added them built-in to Markdown files automatically.

Assessors see this as bad practice since it's outdated for a few years now,
as if you've taken it from someone else's project that did the same thing.

---

In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch".

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it!
Don't introduce the project as a "portfolio project" for the diploma.

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://gamers-gambit-b5f3c4f8c27f.herokuapp.com

Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:
(assuming you have a new folder called `documentation` with an image called "mockup.png")



Note: Markdown files (.md) should not contain HTML elements like `img`, `br`, `div`, `a`, etc, only Markdown formatting.
Find out more about using Markdown elements here:
https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

---

GitHub now supports CALLOUTS in Markdown files.
There are some callouts already embedded in this application for you.
However, if you feel that you want to add more, there are certain ones you can use.

NOTE: the preview for callouts isn't yet supported in Gitpod/Codeanywhere/VSCode/etc.
You'll have to commit/push the changes to GitHub to see it in action.

> [!NOTE]  
> BLUE: Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

## UX

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I wanted the design to be simple and intuitive for all audiences so that it is accessible as possible as the target audience 
is essentially anyone and everyone, as long as they enjoy the world of gaming.

### Colour Scheme

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

For the colour scheme I decided to keep it fairly simple with only a couple of main colours, I knew I wanted red and 
the green kind of came by accident but I was pleased with the overall aesthetic as there was a decent contrast between
the two colours. ChatGPT also had some input into this decision as I was making the logo for the website this is the colour scheme 
it provided when I asked for a vibrant colour scheme including red, and it produced the logo. I was pleased with with feel of it
and decided to use https://imagecolorpicker.com/ to find the exact colours within the logo and then use those colours for the theme of 
the site.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- `#000000` used for the header and footer text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-212529-e71a36-036977) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)


### Typography

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

## Wireframes

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile  and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project. 

You can also generate a more comprehensive diagram of your model/s and their relationships, below is an example of my main midel and 
and auto generated ERD.

Main model

```python
class GameReview(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(
        User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='game_reviews', null=True
        )
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=False, blank=False)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200, blank=True)
    genre = models.ForeignKey(
        Genre, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=False
        )
    tags = models.ManyToManyField('Tag')
    platforms = models.ManyToManyField('Platform')
    description = models.CharField(max_length=550, null=False, blank=False)
    featured_image = CloudinaryField("image", default="placeholder")
    review = models.TextField(null=False, blank=False)
    rating = models.PositiveIntegerField(
        default=1, choices=[(i, i) for i in range(1, 6)]
        )
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.slug:  # Generate slug only if it's not already set
            self.slug = slugify(self.title)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/Project_board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis. Below is a screenshot of the majority of my closed issues, all of the ones that could fit on one page.
I had no open issues when the project was handed in.

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project)](https://github.com/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/closed_issues.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://gamers-gambit-b5f3c4f8c27f.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses an [ElephantSQL](https://elephantsql.com).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from ElephantSQL, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the ElephantSQL using my github account.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - ElephantSQL will be closing at the end of 2024, if you plan to clone/fork this repository
    you must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> - You must then create an instance, follow the steps including picking a zone and selecting the free plan
> - You can then access your details tab and copy the elephant SQL database URL, this is the URL you will use in your
    project and set as a variable on your deployment service (such as Heroku, as was used for this project)
    as your DATABASE_URL (or whatever you chose to name this variable in your django project) 

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Quaim/Capstone_Django_Project)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
